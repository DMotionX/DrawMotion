## [1.7.8] - 2026-10-17

### Initial Official Open-Source Release

This release establishes the baseline open-source architecture of DrawMotion with a fully hardened startup lifecycle, multi-algorithm vector animation engine, and cross-platform build pipelines.

#### Core Engine and Drawing Systems
* **Physics-Based Handwriting Algorithms:** Integrated five distinct mathematical stroke simulation models (Steady, Minimum Jerk, Natural Human, Organic Sketch, and Stop & Go) replicating realistic human handwriting dynamics.
* **Vector Path Tracing:** Automatic parsing and sequential tracing of SVG vectors and raster images with dynamic stroke revelation (`dashOffset` animation).
* **Dual-Layer Anti-Aliased Typography:** High-resolution display layer decoupled from stroke masks, ensuring crisp anti-aliasing even when rendering real-time drop shadows and glow effects.
* **Multitrack Timeline:** Dynamic timeline with audio waveform rendering, audio scrubbing, and scene duration management.
* **Stateless Data Serialization:** Memory-safe clipboard and scene persistence based on JSON serialization, eliminating pointer corruption and memory leaks across scene duplication.

#### Platform Stability and Fault Isolation
* **Native C++ Signal Trapping:** Registered `qInstallMessageHandler` prior to `QApplication` instantiation to capture low-level Qt messages (`qFatal`, `qCritical`, `qWarning`) directly to persistent logs (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DrawMotion\Logs\qt_messages.log`).
* **Python Fault Handler:** Enabled unbuffered `faulthandler` directed to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DrawMotion\Logs\crash_faulthandler.log` with module-level global handles.
* **Watchdog Circuit Breaker:** Implemented a startup failure cap (`max_allowed_failures = 3`) to permanently prevent infinite restart loops.
* **Qt Plugin Bundling:** Explicitly bundled Qt image and icon engines (`imageformats`, `iconengines`, `sensible`, `multimedia`) in Nuitka compilation to prevent segmentation faults during vector rendering.
* **Direct Public Updates:** Configured automated update checking querying official releases from `DMotionX/DrawMotion` with fast parallel multi-stream downloads.
